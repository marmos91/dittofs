# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-04)

**Core value:** Enable one-command DittoFS deployment on Kubernetes with full configurability of storage backends through a declarative CRD
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - ConfigMap and Services

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 6 (ConfigMap and Services)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase - COMPLETE
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-04 - Completed 02-02-PLAN.md (Checksum Annotation)

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 28%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 5
- Average duration: 12 min
- Total execution time: 55 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Operator Foundation | 3/3 | 47 min | 16 min |
| 2. ConfigMap and Services | 2/3 | 8 min | 4 min |
| 3. Storage Management | 0/3 | - | - |
| 4. Percona Integration | 0/3 | - | - |
| 5. Status and Lifecycle | 0/3 | - | - |
| 6. Documentation | 0/3 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-02 (4m), 01-03 (39m with checkpoint), 02-01 (6m), 02-02 (2m)
- Trend: Autonomous plans complete quickly (~2-6 min)

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-04 | Operator relocated to k8s/dittofs-operator/ | Per R1.5, Kubernetes code organized under k8s/ |
| 2026-02-04 | Module path: github.com/marmos91/dittofs/k8s/dittofs-operator | Matches directory structure |
| 2026-02-04 | Secrets RBAC: get;list;watch only | Security - operator only reads secrets |
| 2026-02-04 | Phase 1 complete despite pod CrashLoopBackOff | Image format mismatch expected - operator works |
| 2026-02-04 | cache.path required in ConfigMap | DittoFS requires cache configuration |
| 2026-02-04 | PostgresSecretRef takes precedence over Type field | If both SQLite type and PostgresSecretRef set, Postgres wins silently |
| 2026-02-04 | Infrastructure-only CRD schema | Stores, shares, adapters, users managed via REST API, not CRD |
| 2026-02-04 | Hash includes ConfigMap + secrets + generation | Complete change detection for pod restart |
| 2026-02-04 | ServiceName uses headless naming ({name}-headless) | Anticipates Plan 03 headless service |

### Pending Todos

- **Update DittoFS Docker image** - Image needs to support new control plane config format (operator generates new format, published image expects old format). Address in Phase 6 or earlier.

### Blockers/Concerns

- DittoFS needs containerization before pods can run (future phase)
- Current sample CR expects image that doesn't exist yet

## Phase 2 Progress

**Plan 02-01: CRD and ConfigMap Simplification - COMPLETE**
- CRD simplified to infrastructure-only fields
- ConfigMap generates develop-branch format YAML
- PostgreSQL secret resolution implemented
- Sample CRs updated

**Plan 02-02: Checksum Annotation - COMPLETE**
- pkg/resources package with ComputeConfigHash utility
- collectSecretData helper gathers JWT, admin, postgres secrets
- StatefulSet pod template has dittofs.io/config-hash annotation
- ConfigMap reconciled before StatefulSet ensures hash computable

**Plan 02-03: Service Definitions - PENDING**
