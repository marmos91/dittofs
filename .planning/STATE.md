# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-23)

**Core value:** Enable enterprise-grade multi-protocol file access with unified locking, Kerberos auth, and immediate cross-protocol visibility
**Current focus:** Phase 09 — adapter-layer-cleanup-adapt

## Current Position

Milestone: v0.15.0
Phase: 09 (adapter-layer-cleanup-adapt) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 5
Status: Executing Phase 09
Last activity: 2026-04-24 -- Phase 09 execution started

## Next Actionable

Phase 08 (A0 — Pre-refactor cleanup) and Phase 09 (ADAPT — Adapter layer cleanup) are both pre-A1 tracks with no dependencies. Either can start immediately; they proceed in parallel.

- `/gsd-plan-phase 8` — Pre-refactor cleanup (TD-01..TD-04), GH #420
- `/gsd-plan-phase 9` — Adapter layer cleanup (ADAPT-01..ADAPT-05), GH #427

## Accumulated Context

### v0.15.0 Decisions

- Phase numbering continues from v0.13.0 last phase (7) → v0.15.0 starts at 8 and runs 08-15 (8 phases total)
- Phase directories under `.planning/phases/01-*` through `07-*` (v0.13.0) remain for historical reference; v0.15.0 phase dirs will be `08-*` through `15-*`
- v0.13.0 archive lives at `.planning/milestones/v0.13.0-archive/`
- Fine granularity (from config.json) — 8 phases preserving natural plan boundaries: A0, ADAPT, A1–A6
- Two parallel pre-cleanup tracks (A0 / ADAPT) converge at A3 (engine API change consumes ADAPT groundwork)
- Block key scheme: content-addressable `cas/{hash[0:2]}/{hash[2:4]}/{hash_hex}` with BLAKE3 (via `github.com/zeebo/blake3`)
- Chunking: in-house FastCDC (~200 LoC), min=1MB / avg=4MB / max=16MB, normalization level 2
- Dedup scope: global per metadata store (RefCount spans shares when remote config shared)
- Merkle-root `FileAttr.ObjectID` is lazy (computed at file quiesce), not eager — revisit if dedup hit rate demands eager update
- Migration via `dfsctl blockstore migrate --share <name>`; dual-read shim lives A2–A5; removed in A6 after production rollout confirmed
- v0.13.0 backup backward compatibility NOT required (v0.13.0 never released) — backup code paths are free to break across phases
- Performance regression tolerance: ≤6% on random write (≥600 IOPS), random read (≥1350), sequential write (≥48 MB/s), sequential read (≥60 MB/s)
- A6 (Phase 15) intentionally deferred until A5 (Phase 14) rollout confirmed in production

### v0.13.0 Decisions (archived context)

Historical v0.13.0 decisions preserved in `.planning/milestones/v0.13.0-archive/` for reference; the v0.15.0 refactor deletes `BackupHoldProvider` + `FinalizationCallback` (v0.13.0 scaffolding) in Phase 08.

### Pending Todos

- After Phase 08 + Phase 09 planning: run both phases in parallel (independent cleanup tracks)
- Before Phase 11 (A2) start: ensure `TestBlockStoreImmutableOverwrites` E2E skeleton is drafted and is confirmed failing on `develop` (proof of bug)
- Before Phase 14 (A5) ship: benchmark VM-fleet dedup fixture achieves ≥40% reduction (VER-03 gate)
- Before Phase 15 (A6) merge: confirm `dfsctl blockstore migrate status` reports 100% for every production share

### Blockers/Concerns

None.

## Session Continuity

Last session: --stopped-at
Stopped at: Phase 09 context gathered
Next action: `/gsd-plan-phase 8` (A0 — Pre-refactor cleanup) OR `/gsd-plan-phase 9` (ADAPT) — both are actionable in parallel

**Planned Phase:** 09 (Adapter layer cleanup (ADAPT)) — 5 plans — 2026-04-24T07:23:11.918Z
