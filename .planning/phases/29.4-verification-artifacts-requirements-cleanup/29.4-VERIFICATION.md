# Phase 29.4: Verification Artifacts & Requirements Cleanup Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Create formal verification artifacts for Phases 28 and 29 and update REQUIREMENTS.md traceability to close audit gaps from v3.5 milestone audit

**Verified:** 2026-02-26T17:30:00Z

**Status:** passed

**Re-verification:** No -- initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Phase 28 has a VERIFICATION.md with per-requirement evidence for all 11 REF-04 sub-requirements | VERIFIED | `.planning/phases/28-smb-adapter-restructuring/28-VERIFICATION.md` exists with Requirements Coverage table containing all 11 REF-04 sub-requirements (REF-04.1 through REF-04.11), each marked SATISFIED with specific evidence |
| 2 | Phase 29 has a VERIFICATION.md with per-requirement evidence for all 8 REF-05 and 9 REF-06 sub-requirements | VERIFIED | `.planning/phases/29-core-layer-decomposition/29-VERIFICATION.md` exists with Requirements Coverage table containing all 17 sub-requirements (REF-05.1 through REF-05.8, REF-06.1 through REF-06.9), each marked SATISFIED with specific evidence |
| 3 | REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table shows Complete (without 'pending formal verification') for REF-04, REF-05, REF-06 | VERIFIED | Traceability table shows `Complete (11/11)` for REF-04, `Complete (8/8)` for REF-05, `Complete (9/9)` for REF-06. Zero occurrences of "pending formal verification" in file |
| 4 | All evidence in VERIFICATION.md files is confirmed against current codebase (file existence, type/interface grep) | VERIFIED | Phase 28 verification references 13 artifacts with specific file paths and line numbers. Phase 29 verification references 37 artifacts with specific file paths and line numbers. All artifacts confirmed present via codebase verification |

**Score:** 4/4 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `.planning/phases/28-smb-adapter-restructuring/28-VERIFICATION.md` | Formal verification for Phase 28 REF-04 (SMB Adapter Restructuring) | VERIFIED | File exists with YAML frontmatter (status: passed, score: 11/11), Observable Truths table (11 items), Required Artifacts table (13 items), Key Link Verification table (7 links), Requirements Coverage table (11 REF-04 sub-requirements) |
| `.planning/phases/29-core-layer-decomposition/29-VERIFICATION.md` | Formal verification for Phase 29 REF-05 + REF-06 | VERIFIED | File exists with YAML frontmatter (status: passed, score: 10/10), Observable Truths table (10 items), Required Artifacts table (37 items), Key Link Verification table (10 links), Requirements Coverage table (17 sub-requirements: 8 REF-05 + 9 REF-06) |
| `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` | Updated traceability table with completion status | VERIFIED | File contains traceability table with REF-04: Complete (11/11), REF-05: Complete (8/8), REF-06: Complete (9/9). All checkboxes marked `[x]` for REF-04.1-04.11, REF-05.1-05.8, REF-06.1-06.9. Updated timestamp: "2026-02-26 -- formal verification for REF-04, REF-05, REF-06 completed in Phase 29.4" |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|----|--------|---------|
| 28-VERIFICATION.md | REQUIREMENTS.md | REF-04 sub-requirement IDs match | WIRED | Both files contain identical REF-04.1 through REF-04.11 (11 items verified) |
| 29-VERIFICATION.md | REQUIREMENTS.md | REF-05 and REF-06 sub-requirement IDs match | WIRED | Both files contain identical REF-05.1 through REF-05.8 (8 items) and REF-06.1 through REF-06.9 (9 items) -- total 17 items verified |
| 28-VERIFICATION.md | 28-*-SUMMARY.md files | Evidence sourced from phase 28 summaries | WIRED | Requirements Coverage table references source plans 28-01 through 28-05 |
| 29-VERIFICATION.md | 29-*-SUMMARY.md files | Evidence sourced from phase 29 summaries | WIRED | Requirements Coverage table references source plans 29-01 through 29-07 |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| REF-04 (verification) | 29.4-01 | Phase 28 formal verification artifact created | SATISFIED | `.planning/phases/28-smb-adapter-restructuring/28-VERIFICATION.md` exists with 11/11 sub-requirements verified, status: passed |
| REF-05 (verification) | 29.4-01 | Phase 29 formal verification artifact created (REF-05 portion) | SATISFIED | `.planning/phases/29-core-layer-decomposition/29-VERIFICATION.md` exists with 8/8 REF-05 sub-requirements verified |
| REF-06 (verification) | 29.4-01 | Phase 29 formal verification artifact created (REF-06 portion) | SATISFIED | `.planning/phases/29-core-layer-decomposition/29-VERIFICATION.md` exists with 9/9 REF-06 sub-requirements verified |
| traceability | 29.4-01 | REQUIREMENTS.md traceability updated to reflect completion | SATISFIED | Traceability table shows Complete (11/11), Complete (8/8), Complete (9/9) for REF-04, REF-05, REF-06 respectively. Zero "pending formal verification" mentions. Updated timestamp reflects Phase 29.4 completion |

**Coverage:** 4/4 requirements satisfied

### Anti-Patterns Found

None. All verification artifacts follow the established format from Phase 26. No TODO/FIXME markers. No placeholder sections.

### Human Verification Required

None. All success criteria are programmatically verifiable and have been verified.

## Verification Summary

**Status:** PASSED

All 4 success criteria from Phase 29.4 PLAN verified against actual files:

1. VERIFIED: Phase 28 VERIFICATION.md exists with all 11 REF-04 sub-requirements covered in Requirements Coverage table
2. VERIFIED: Phase 29 VERIFICATION.md exists with all 8 REF-05 and 9 REF-06 sub-requirements covered in Requirements Coverage table
3. VERIFIED: REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table shows Complete status without "pending formal verification" for REF-04, REF-05, REF-06
4. VERIFIED: All evidence cross-referenced against actual codebase (not just SUMMARY claims)

**Requirements Completed:**
- REF-04 (verification): Phase 28 formal verification artifact created
- REF-05 (verification): Phase 29 formal verification artifact created for REF-05
- REF-06 (verification): Phase 29 formal verification artifact created for REF-06
- traceability: REQUIREMENTS.md traceability updated

**Artifacts:** 3/3 verified present and substantive

**Key Links:** 4/4 verified wired (requirement ID matching between verification files and REQUIREMENTS.md)

**Build Status:** Clean (`go build ./...` passes with no errors)

**Commit Evidence:**
- Task 1: `89123184` - Phase 28 VERIFICATION.md created
- Task 2: `9ceff8d8` - Phase 29 VERIFICATION.md created
- Task 3: `284e49d6` - REQUIREMENTS.md traceability updated

**Verification Cross-Check:**
- Phase 28 VERIFICATION.md contains: REF-04.1, REF-04.2, REF-04.3, REF-04.4, REF-04.5, REF-04.6, REF-04.7, REF-04.8, REF-04.9, REF-04.10, REF-04.11 (11 items)
- Phase 29 VERIFICATION.md contains: REF-05.1, REF-05.2, REF-05.3, REF-05.4, REF-05.5, REF-05.6, REF-05.7, REF-05.8, REF-06.1, REF-06.2, REF-06.3, REF-06.4, REF-06.5, REF-06.6, REF-06.7, REF-06.8, REF-06.9 (17 items)
- REQUIREMENTS.md contains: All 28 sub-requirements listed above with `[x]` checkboxes
- Requirement ID set intersection: 100% match (28/28 items)

**Traceability Evidence:**
- REF-04 line in REQUIREMENTS.md: `| REF-04: SMB Adapter Restructuring | 28 | Complete (11/11) |`
- REF-05 line in REQUIREMENTS.md: `| REF-05: Core Object Decomposition | 29 | Complete (8/8) |`
- REF-06 line in REQUIREMENTS.md: `| REF-06: Code Quality Improvements | 29 | Complete (9/9) |`
- Updated timestamp: `*Updated: 2026-02-26 -- formal verification for REF-04, REF-05, REF-06 completed in Phase 29.4*`

**Phase Goal Achieved:** Yes. Formal verification artifacts created for both Phase 28 (REF-04 -- 11 sub-requirements) and Phase 29 (REF-05 + REF-06 -- 17 sub-requirements). REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table updated to remove all "pending formal verification" notes. All evidence confirmed against current codebase state. v3.5 milestone audit gaps fully closed.
