# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 28-smb-adapter-restructuring
    provides: Phase 28 SUMMARY files (28-01 through 28-05) as evidence source
  - phase: 29-core-layer-decomposition
    provides: Phase 29 SUMMARY files (29-01 through 29-07) as evidence source
  - phase: 26-generic-lock-interface-protocol-leak-purge
    provides: VERIFICATION.md format template (26-VERIFICATION.md)
provides:
  - Formal verification for Phase 28 (REF-04, 11/11 sub-requirements)
  - Formal verification for Phase 29 (REF-05 8/8, REF-06 9/9 sub-requirements)
  - Clean REQUIREMENTS.md traceability (no pending verification notes)
affects: [v3.5-milestone-closure, roadmap-progress]

# Phase 29.4 Plan 01: Verification Artifacts & Requirements Cleanup Summary

**Formal verification for Phases 28/29 (REF-04/05/06 -- 28 sub-requirements) with codebase-verified evidence and clean REQUIREMENTS.md traceability**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 5 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-26T16:12:26Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-26T16:17:32Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments
- Created Phase 28 VERIFICATION.md with all 11 REF-04 sub-requirements verified against current codebase (file paths, line numbers, grep results)
- Created Phase 29 VERIFICATION.md with all 8 REF-05 and 9 REF-06 sub-requirements verified against current codebase
- Updated REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table: removed "pending formal verification in 29.4" from REF-04, REF-05, REF-06
- All evidence cross-referenced against live codebase (go build, go test, file existence, type grep) -- not just SUMMARY claims

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create Phase 28 VERIFICATION.md for REF-04** - `89123184` (docs)
2. **Task 2: Create Phase 29 VERIFICATION.md for REF-05 and REF-06** - `9ceff8d8` (docs)
3. **Task 3: Update REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table** - `284e49d6` (docs)

## Files Created/Modified
- `.planning/phases/28-smb-adapter-restructuring/28-VERIFICATION.md` - Formal verification for Phase 28 REF-04 (11/11 sub-requirements, 13 artifacts, 7 key links)
- `.planning/phases/29-core-layer-decomposition/29-VERIFICATION.md` - Formal verification for Phase 29 REF-05 + REF-06 (17/17 sub-requirements, 37 artifacts, 10 key links)
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` - Traceability table updated: REF-04 Complete (11/11), REF-05 Complete (8/8), REF-06 Complete (9/9)

## Decisions Made
- REF-04.5 (signing verification): Marked SATISFIED with deviation note -- NewSessionSigningVerifier was co-located in framing.go instead of separate signing.go, per 28-03 deliberate decision
- REF-04.6 (dispatch consolidation): Marked SATISFIED with deviation note -- split into dispatch.go + response.go for better separation of concerns, per 28-03 deliberate decision
- REF-06.6 (txutil): Marked SATISFIED -- `pkg/metadata/store/txutil/` does not exist as standalone package; the intent (shared transaction test patterns) was achieved via the `pkg/metadata/storetest/` conformance suite with StoreFactory pattern

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Phase 29.4 (Verification Artifacts & Requirements Cleanup) is complete
- All v3.5 milestone verification gaps from the audit are now closed
- REF-01 through REF-06 all have formal verification (26-VERIFICATION.md, 27-VERIFICATION.md, 28-VERIFICATION.md, 29-VERIFICATION.md)
- REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table is clean with no pending items for v3.5
