<current_state>
Phase 32 is fully complete (3/3 plans, 10/10 UAT passed). We were running
`/gsd:complete-milestone` for v3.6 Windows Compatibility but ran out of context
at the very first step (pre-flight check / audit verification).

The milestone has NO audit file yet (`.planning/v3.6-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` missing).
The workflow recommends running `/gsd:audit-milestone` first, but the user may
choose to proceed without it.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Phase 32 execution: all 3 plans executed and merged to develop
- PR #237: rebased onto develop, force-pushed, all CI green (15/15 checks)
- Copilot comments: 3 addressed (KNOWN_FAILURES, validate negotiate, create contexts)
- UAT: 10/10 passed, 0 issues
- Branch merged to develop, local develop pulled and up to date
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Run `/gsd:complete-milestone` for v3.6 (was just started, needs full execution)
  1. Pre-flight: decide whether to audit first or proceed
  2. Verify readiness: confirm all phases complete
  3. Gather stats: git range, LOC, timeline
  4. Extract accomplishments from SUMMARY files
  5. Archive milestone (ROADMAP + REQUIREMENTS to milestones/)
  6. Evolve PROJECT.md
  7. Reorganize ROADMAP.md
  8. Git tag v3.6, commit, offer next steps
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Rebased Phase 32 branch onto develop using patch approach (not interactive rebase) because squashed commits overlapped with already-merged Phase 30/31 work
- PR scoped to Phase 32 only (Phases 30/31 already merged via separate PRs)
- Integration test failure was flaky LocalStack (container exit code 245), re-run passed
</decisions_made>

<context>
v3.6 milestone (Windows Compatibility) includes Phases 29.8, 30, 31, 32, 32.5.
All implementation phases are done. Phase 32.5 is a USER CHECKPOINT (manual verification)
which the UAT already covered (10/10 passed). The roadmap shows phases 30-32 as [x] complete.
Phase 29.8 has two directories - one complete (29.8-ms-protocol-test-suite-ci) and one
stale/pending (29.8-microsoft-protocol-test-suite-ci-integration with only CONTEXT.md).
The stale one can be ignored/cleaned up during milestone completion.
</context>

<next_action>
Run `/gsd:complete-milestone` in a fresh context. The workflow will:
1. Note missing audit and ask whether to audit first or proceed
2. Walk through the 8-step milestone completion process
3. Archive v3.6, tag, and prepare for next milestone
</next_action>
